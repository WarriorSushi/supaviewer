# SupaViewer - Project Brief

## Mission Statement

SupaViewer is the premier discovery and curation platform for AI-generated video content. We exist to elevate quality AI cinema by providing a dedicated space where creators can showcase their work and audiences can discover the best AI-generated films and shorts.

## The Problem We're Solving

As AI video generation tools rapidly improve, there's an explosion of AI-generated content with no centralized platform for discovery and quality curation. YouTube mixes AI videos with everything else, and there's no "Rotten Tomatoes" or "IMDb" equivalent for AI cinema.

Creators making thoughtful, high-quality AI films have nowhere to showcase their work to an audience that specifically seeks AI-generated content. Viewers interested in AI video have no reliable way to discover quality content beyond algorithmic recommendations.

## Our Solution

SupaViewer creates a curated hub specifically for AI-generated videos over 30 seconds in length. We combine:

- **Discovery**: A beautiful, film-first interface for browsing quality AI videos
- **Curation**: Manual approval process ensures quality standards
- **Rating System**: Community-driven ratings help surface the best content
- **Creator Profiles**: Give AI video creators a portfolio and presence
- **Metadata**: Tag videos by AI tool used, genre, and style for better discovery

## Target Audience

### Primary Users

**Creators**: People making AI-generated videos who want to showcase their work to an engaged audience. They're excited about AI filmmaking as an art form and want recognition.

**Viewers**: Early adopters, AI enthusiasts, filmmakers, and curious audiences who want to see what's possible with AI video generation. They value quality over viral content.

**Curators**: Power users who rate and review videos, helping surface the best content. They see themselves as tastemakers in an emerging medium.

### Secondary Users

**Industry Professionals**: Studios, agencies, and brands researching AI video capabilities and scouting talent.

## Core Value Proposition

**For Creators**: "The prestigious platform to showcase your AI video work"

**For Viewers**: "Discover the best AI-generated films and shorts, curated for quality"

**For the Platform**: First-mover advantage in AI video curation before the market explodes

## What Makes Us Different

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Manual curation, not algorithmic spam
- **Film-First Design**: Cinematic aesthetic, not typical tech platform
- **Minimum Length Requirement**: 30+ seconds means storytelling, not viral clips
- **Transparent AI Usage**: Clear labeling of which AI tools were used
- **Creator-Focused**: Give creators a proper portfolio, not just a feed

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (MVP - Months 1-3)
- 100+ approved videos
- 500+ registered users
- 50+ active creators
- Average 4+ star ratings on quality content

### Phase 2 (Growth - Months 4-12)
- 1,000+ videos
- 10,000+ users
- Recognized as "the place" for AI video in the community
- Media coverage in AI/film publications

## What We're NOT Building (For Now)

- Short-form content platform (no TikTok competitor)
- Direct video hosting (YouTube embeds only)
- Social network with extensive social features
- Monetization/marketplace (future consideration)
- Video editing or creation tools
- Real-time video uploads (curated submission process)

## Strategic Positioning

We're positioning ourselves ahead of the AI video content boom. As tools like Sora, Runway, and others become more accessible, quality AI video content will explode. Being established as THE discovery platform before that happens gives us first-mover advantage.

Think: Letterboxd for film buffs, but for AI video. We're building for the passionate early community that will define the space.

## Brand Personality

- **Curatorial**: We have taste and standards
- **Cinephile**: We treat AI video as art, not novelty
- **Forward-Looking**: Excited about the future of AI filmmaking
- **Unpretentious**: Accessible to newcomers, not gatekeeping
- **Quality-Obsessed**: Every video should be worth watching

We are NOT: Generic tech startup, corporate, boring, chasing viral trends, AI hype without substance.
